A learning roadmap for agentic AI — **from LLM fundamentals to building multi-agent systems**. Structured 7-stage path: from "what is an LLM, how do tokens work" all the way to multi-agent orchestration and local deployment. Each stage has must-run demos, required reading, and curated projects.

---

## 🎯 Why this exists

If you want to learn AI applications or grow from basics into multi-agent systems — **the most common problem isn't lack of resources, it's not knowing where to start**. Awesome lists in English and Chinese have hundreds of repos but no path; people learning Claude Code, LangGraph, or RAG end up scattered across communities, using different terms, recommending different starter projects.

So we curated **134 high-quality projects** into a "from zero to advanced multi-agent" learning roadmap, organized as **7 stages**. Each stage tells you exactly **what to learn, which Hello-X demos to run, which projects to study, and what self-check to pass before advancing**.

After the main path, you go from "**LLM user**" to "**agent system builder**" — capable of designing multi-agent collaboration, writing your own MCP server, and shipping real agent systems.

## 🗺️ Learning Map (Two Tracks)

![AI Agent Learning Map](resources/diagrams/learning-map.png)

After **Stages 0-2 (shared foundations)**, pick a track based on your goal:

- **Track A — CLI Power User**: you want to **USE** existing CLI agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, etc.) to get work done — not build agents from scratch. 3 sub-stages (A1-A3).
- **Track B — Agent Builder**: you want to **BUILD** your own agents — learn frameworks, write ReAct, design multi-agent systems. Stages 3-7 main path.

The two tracks are **not mutually exclusive** — most people start with A to get hands-on, then come back to B for internals (or vice versa). Stage 5 (Claude Code Ecosystem) is used by both tracks.

### Shared Foundations (Stages 0-2)

| Stage | Topic | Key Content | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | [Foundations](stages/00-foundations.en.md) | Python · CLI · git · API · JSON | 1-2 wks |
| **1** | [LLM Basics](stages/01-llm-basics.en.md) | tokens · API · model comparison · local LLM | 1 wk |
| **2** | [Prompt Engineering](stages/02-prompt-engineering.en.md) | system prompts · few-shot · CoT | 1-2 wks |

### Track A — CLI Power User (use CLIs to get work done)

| Stage | Topic | Key Content | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A1** | [CLI Agent Intro & Selection](tracks/cli/A1-cli-intro.en.md) | 6-CLI comparison · install · first run | 1 wk |
| **A2** | [CLI Workflow Patterns](tracks/cli/A2-cli-workflow.en.md) | CLAUDE.md · slash commands · multi-step decomposition | 1-2 wks |
| **A3** | [Integration & Production](tracks/cli/A3-cli-production.en.md) | MCP-into-CLI · CI automation · cost / observability | 1-2 wks |

> **Track A total time**: 3-5 weeks (with Stages 0-2: 6-8 weeks). Core reference: [`resources/cli-agents-guide.en.md`](resources/cli-agents-guide.en.md).

### Track B — Agent Builder (build agents from scratch)

| Stage | Topic | Key Content | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **3** ⭐ | [Tool Use & Hello Agent](stages/03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md) | function calling · ReAct · 5 Hello-X | 2-3 wks |
| **4** | [Agent Frameworks](stages/04-agent-frameworks.en.md) | LangGraph · AutoGen · CrewAI · Smolagents | 2-3 wks |
| **5** ⭐⭐ | [Claude Code Ecosystem](stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md) | MCP · Skills · Plugins · Marketplace (used by both tracks) | 3-4 wks |
| **6** | [Memory · RAG · Advanced](stages/06-memory-rag.en.md) | vector DB · long-term memory · contextual retrieval | 2 wks |
| **7** | [Multi-Agent · Advanced](stages/07-multi-agent-production.en.md) | multi-agent orchestration · eval · observability · advanced SDK | 2-4 wks |

> **Track B total time**: minimum **14-19 weeks**, realistic **5-6 months** (5-8 hr/week part-time)

> 💡 **Want a concrete cross-stage example?** [Build Your First AI Agent in 7 Steps](walkthroughs/build-first-agent-in-7-steps.en.md) — same Paper Summary Bot traced from Stage 1 through Stage 7, ~350 lines of executable code (**Track B**)

After the main path, pick one of 5 specialized branches. **Not sure which?**

![Branch decision tree](resources/diagrams/branch-decision-tree.png)

> 💡 **The Everyday User branch can be read directly without walking the main path** — it's for people who want to use AI without writing code.

| Branch | Best for | Topics |
|---|---|---|
| 🔬 [Researcher](branches/for-researcher.en.md) | Grad students, postdocs, PIs | Lit triage · paper writing · multi-agent review |
| 💻 [Developer](branches/for-developer.en.md) | Software engineers | Cursor · Aider · CLI delegation · code review |
| 🎓 [Teacher](branches/for-teacher.en.md) 🚧 | Teachers, instructors | Lesson planning · slides · student feedback *(thinnest section, contributions welcome)* |
| 📊 [Knowledge Worker](branches/for-knowledge-worker.en.md) | Consultants, PMs, analysts | Email · meeting notes · report automation |
| 👥 [Everyday User](branches/for-everyday-users.en.md) | ChatGPT / Claude.ai users | Daily writing · learning · privacy · CLI agent intro |

## 💡 How to Learn

Welcome — future agent system builder. Some guidance before you start.

This roadmap balances concepts with hands-on work, helping you **transform from an LLM user into an agent system builder**. It assumes **basic Python**. Before starting:

- **Basic Python** — written functions, used APIs, can read JSON
- **Basic git** — clone, commit, push
- **Motivation to learn** — agents are the fastest-changing area in AI 2025+, and require sustained effort

If anything's missing, do Stage 0; if not, **start at Stage 1**.

The main path has 4 parts:

- **Part 1 (Stages 0-2): Foundations & LLM Basics** — Python / git / API, what's an LLM, prompt design
- **Part 2 (Stages 3-4): Build Your Agent** — from tool use to agents, learn the major frameworks
- **Part 3 (Stage 5): Claude Code Ecosystem** — MCP / Skills / Plugins, the heart of the path
- **Part 4 (Stages 6-7): Advanced Integration** — memory / RAG / multi-agent collaboration

After the main path (14-19 weeks), pick a branch.

The most important advice: **don't skip Hello-X demos**. Each stage's Hello-X is "you can't learn this without doing it" — skim past it and you'll get stuck later.

Ready? [Start at Stage 0](stages/00-foundations.en.md).
