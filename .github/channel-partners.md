| `replied-negative` | Partner declined or asked to redirect |
| `merged-or-listed` | Cross-link landed (PR merged / featured / listed) |

## Sequencing rule

**Pace: 1-2 outbound sends per day.** Reasoning:

- Replies need to be handled. If we batch-send all 8 in one day, we can't respond
  to early-positive replies before they cool.
- Multiple open conversations dilute attention; one-at-a-time keeps quality.
- If 5 replies land in week 1, that's a good problem; if 0 land, we don't burn
  all our cards before learning what's not working.

Suggested first-week order (low-risk → high-risk, **revised 2026-05-09**
after upstream-target audit caught the awesome-claude-code reorg):

1. **Day 1**: [#6 punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers PR](outreach/awesome-mcp-servers.md)
   — has `## Tutorials` section, ★86k repo, reciprocal cite already exists.
   Lowest-risk concrete-action target.
2. **Day 2**: [#5 awesome-claude-code **issue**](outreach/awesome-claude-code.md)
   — repo mid-reorg, no PR-able sections; open an issue parking the proposal
   for when their new TOC lands.
3. **Day 3**: [#1 Datawhale](outreach/datawhale.md) — most strategic for zh-Hans
   reach (we cite Hello-Agents Extra05/08).
4. **Day 4**: [#2 liyupi](outreach/liyupi.md) — high reach if accepted (★13k
   resource hub).
5. **Day 5**: [#4 LangChain (kyrolabs/awesome-langchain)](outreach/langchain-ai.md).
6. **Day 6**: pause — review responses to date.
7. **Day 7+**: [#3 HuggingFace](outreach/huggingface-zh.md), then
   [#7 Zhipu](outreach/zhipu.md), [#8 Moonshot](outreach/moonshot.md) only
   after digesting earlier feedback.

## Update protocol

- Always update this matrix when contacted / received reply / closed.
- Use `git commit -m "outreach: status update for <target> (<status>)"` so the
  log is greppable.
- Dates: ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Notes: 1-2 lines max — full context lives in the per-target `outreach/<slug>.md`.

## What NOT to do

- ❌ Bulk-send same template to all 8 in one day — looks like spam
- ❌ Lead with star count (★525) — small to ★1k+ partners; lead with scope
- ❌ Promise things we won't ship (e.g., "we'll add X if you cross-link")
- ❌ Ping after one reply — give 5+ business days
- ❌ Pitch via Discord DM unless explicitly invited (follow each project's
  preferred contact channel; Discord DM cold = annoying)
- ❌ Edit pitch templates without recording the change in the file's git history

## Success indicators

Order by signal strength (top = stronger):

1. **Cross-link landed** in their canonical README / docs / awesome-list
2. **Public mention** (their tweet / post / blog cites us)
3. **Reciprocal listing** in their tutorials/learning section
4. **Soft acknowledgment** — they replied positively but no concrete action

If by **2026-06-01** no signal #1-3 has landed across all 8: pause outreach,
audit the pitch tone (likely too founder-y, not enough technical specifics).
