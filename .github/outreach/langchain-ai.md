# Outreach: LangChain ecosystem (langchain-ai / kyrolabs/awesome-langchain)

> **Status**: not contacted · **Channel**: GitHub issue/PR
> **Primary lang**: en (with zh as bonus)
> **Last updated**: 2026-05-09
> **Repos**:
> - https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain (main repo)
> - https://github.com/kyrolabs/awesome-langchain (community awesome list ★9k+)

**Why this target**: LangChain is the gateway agent framework for ~80% of zh-language developers. Our Stage 4 covers it; our §11 catalog now includes Langchain-Chatchat (★37k) and the Chinese LangChain getting-started guide. Cross-link is natural.

**Pitch angle**:
- For `langchain-ai/langchain` itself: too big a target; aim instead at the **community awesome list** (`kyrolabs/awesome-langchain`).
- For `kyrolabs/awesome-langchain`: we're a multilingual learning-order complement to their flat catalog.

**Their counter-value**: ★9k exposure to LangChain-curious developers worldwide.

## Variant 1 — Social post (X / LinkedIn, ~280 chars)

```
LangChain learners often ask: "I have the docs, but where do I actually start?"

Built a 7-stage trilingual learning roadmap (zh-TW · zh-Hans · en). Stage 4 walks
through LangChain / LangGraph / AutoGen with cost & time estimates per step.
145+ curated projects · MIT · ★525 week 1.

## Variant 2 — GitHub PR to kyrolabs/awesome-langchain (200-300 words)

**PR title**: Add awesome-agentic-ai-zh to "Tutorials & Learning Resources"

**Diff**:

```diff
+ - [`WenyuChiou/awesome-agentic-ai-zh`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/awesome-agentic-ai-zh)
+   — Trilingual (zh-TW · zh-Hans · en) 7-stage learning roadmap for agentic AI.
+   Stage 4 covers LangChain / LangGraph / AutoGen with prerequisites, time
+   estimates, and hands-on exercises. Catalog includes 62 MCP servers / Skills
+   grouped by 14 use cases, with a dedicated section for the Chinese-language
+   ecosystem (Langchain-Chatchat, LangChain Chinese getting-started guide,
+   Qwen-Agent, Coze).
```

**PR description**:

```markdown
Hi kyrolabs maintainers,

I'm proposing addition of [awesome-agentic-ai-zh](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/awesome-agentic-ai-zh)
to the "Tutorials" or "Learning Resources" section of awesome-langchain.

**Why this is a good fit**:
- Trilingual (zh-TW canonical, zh-Hans, English) — fills a gap for non-English
  learners
- Stage 4 specifically walks through LangChain / LangGraph / AutoGen with
  prerequisites, time estimates, and hands-on exercises
- §11 of our catalog has 7 Chinese-ecosystem entries including
  `chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat` (★37k) and `liaokongVFX/LangChain-Chinese-
  Getting-Started-Guide`

**What this is NOT**:
- Not a competing awesome-list (we're a learning-order roadmap; readers
  graduate to your flat catalog after Stage 4)
- Not LangChain-only — covers Stage 0 foundations, MCP, multi-agent, and
  production

**Stats (week 1)**: ★525 / 50 forks / 3,185 unique visitors / 1,099 clones /
408 unique cloners / 3 community contributors. MIT licensed. CI runs banned-
word + link-rot lint on every PR.

If this isn't the right section or shape, please redirect. Thanks for
maintaining awesome-langchain.

## Variant 3 — Email to LangChain DevRel (150 words)

```
Hi LangChain team,

I built awesome-agentic-ai-zh — a trilingual (zh-TW / zh-Hans / en) 7-stage
learning roadmap for agentic AI. ★525 in week 1, 3,185 unique visitors,
heavy zh-language community traction (top referrer is Threads at 42%).

Stage 4 specifically walks new developers through LangChain → LangGraph
→ AutoGen with prerequisites and cost/time estimates per step. Designed
to bridge "I know Python" to "I can build a working agent."

Two questions:
1. Is there a LangChain-side surface where this would fit (Learn, blog,
   docs sidebar)?
2. Any specific LangChain features I should cover better in Stage 4? Open
   to feedback.

No expectation, just opening dialogue.

— Wenyu

## Notes

- **First target**: kyrolabs/awesome-langchain (community awesome list, lower
  barrier to merge)
- **Second target**: LangChain blog/docs (higher signal but harder to land)
- Avoid pitching `langchain-ai/langchain` itself directly — too big, signal is
  drowned out
- LangSmith / LangGraph teams are separate — different DevRel; don't pitch all
  three at once
